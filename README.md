# **Weather Data Visualization**

The Weather Data Visualization project is a Python-based application that fetches real-time weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application retrieves essential weather information, including temperature, humidity, and a brief weather description, and visualizes this data using bar plots. 
This project serves as a practical example of how to integrate APIs, handle JSON data, and create visualizations using popular Python libraries such as `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

**FILES INCLUDED IN THE REPO:**
- weather_data_visual.py (Main Python File)

**KEY FEATURES:**
- **Real-Time Weather Data Retrieval**: The application allows users to input a city name and fetches the current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This feature demonstrates how to make HTTP requests and handle API responses in Python.
- **Data Extraction**: The project includes a function that extracts relevant weather information from the API response. This includes temperature (in Celsius), humidity (in percentage), and a textual description of the weather conditions. This showcases the ability to parse JSON data effectively.
- **Data Visualization**: The application visualizes the extracted weather data using bar plots. The seaborn library is utilized to create aesthetically pleasing and informative visualizations. This feature highlights the importance of data visualization in understanding and interpreting data.
- **User Interaction**: The application prompts users to enter a city name, making it interactive and user-friendly. This aspect emphasizes the importance of user input in applications and how it can drive functionality.
- **Error Handling**: The project includes basic error handling to manage invalid city names or API request failures. This ensures that users receive informative feedback when something goes wrong, enhancing the overall user experience.

**TOOLS/TECH. USED:**
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Requests**: A library for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library used to create DataFrames for visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

**INSTALLATION AND USAGE:**
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries using pip. Here are the steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine:
   - git clone https://github.com/dragonday3/API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION.git

2. Install the required libraries:
   - pip install requests matplotlib seaborn pandas
   - Move to Step 3 if the libraries are already installed in your system.

3. Replace the placeholder API key in the code with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.

4. Run the application:
   - python weather_data_visual.py

5. Follow the prompts to enter a city name and view the weather data and visualization.
